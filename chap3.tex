\chapter{Reconstructed Objects}

The state-of-the-art CMS detector records the detailed information of the collisions and stored them into datasets. In the datasets, we can access to event information with fully reconstructed objects including hits, tracks, muons, and vertex, which will be crucial for our data analysis to study B meson physics in heavy-ion collisions.
