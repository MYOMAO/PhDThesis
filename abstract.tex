A novel analysis of fully reconstructed $B^0_s$, $B^0$, and $B^+$ mesons decay into $J/\psi$ and strange hadrons using Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment 2017 pp dataset and 2018 PbPb data at the center of mass energy per nucleon $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is presented in this thesis. We apply machine learning techniques along with multivariate analysis to obtain significant B-meson signals and extend the kinematic regime of B-meson measurements. In our analysis, $B^0_s$ signal of greater than 5 $\sigma$ significance is first confirmed in heavy-ion collisions. The inclusive beauty production cross section in pp collisions from the $B^+$ exclusive decay cross section down to zero transverse momentum is measured. The precise measurement of B-meson nuclear modification factor and $B^0_s$/$B^+$ ratio and the comparisons with theoretical model predictions will also be discussed. Our results will help elucidate the beauty production and hadronizaton mechanisms in vacuum and quark-gluon plasma at the LHC energy.
